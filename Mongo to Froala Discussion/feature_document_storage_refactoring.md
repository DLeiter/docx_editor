# Feature: Document Storage Refactoring with Paragraph-Level MongoDB Structure

## Epic Link
Document Management System Enhancement

## Feature Summary
Refactor the document storage architecture to implement paragraph-level granularity in MongoDB, create API v3 endpoints to support the new structure, and develop a proof-of-concept frontend implementation using Froala editor to validate the approach.

## User Story
**As a** document editor user  
**I want** to have my document changes saved at the paragraph level  
**So that** I can enjoy faster save operations, reduced data transfer, and better collaborative editing experience without conflicts when multiple users edit different parts of the same document.

## Business Value
- Improves application performance by minimizing data transfer during document editing
- Enhances user experience with faster, more responsive saving
- Enables future collaborative editing features
- Reduces server load and database write operations
- Provides foundation for more granular document history and versioning

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Document data in MongoDB must be restructured to store paragraphs as individually addressable elements with unique IDs
2. API v3 endpoints must be implemented to support:
   - Retrieving a complete document with all paragraphs
   - Updating a single paragraph by ID
   - Adding a new paragraph at a specific position
   - Deleting a paragraph by ID
   - Updating the complete HTML cache
3. All API endpoints must maintain backward compatibility by continuing to support v2 endpoints
4. A proof-of-concept implementation in the frontend must demonstrate:
   - Paragraph ID tracking within the Froala editor
   - Detection of paragraph-specific changes
   - API calls that update only the modified paragraph(s)
   - Proper synchronization of the document structure
5. Performance testing must demonstrate at least 30% reduction in data transfer volume during typical editing sessions compared to the current whole-document save approach
6. Migration script must be provided to convert existing documents to the new structure without data loss

## Definition of Ready
- MongoDB schema design for the new structure is finalized and documented
- API endpoints for v3 are specified with request/response formats
- Frontend implementation approach is documented
- Performance benchmarks for the current system are established as a baseline
- Risk assessment for backward compatibility is completed

## Tasks Breakdown
1. **MongoDB Schema Design and Implementation** (5 points)
   - Design new document schema with paragraph-level structure
   - Create MongoDB indexes for optimal query performance
   - Develop and test migration script for existing documents
   - Document the new schema and migration process

2. **API v3 Endpoint Development** (8 points)
   - Implement document retrieval endpoint with paragraph structure
   - Develop paragraph-specific CRUD endpoints
   - Create HTML cache update endpoint
   - Implement version compatibility layer
   - Write comprehensive tests for all endpoints

3. **Frontend Proof-of-Concept** (13 points)
   - Implement paragraph ID tracking in Froala editor
   - Develop change detection for individual paragraphs
   - Create Angular service for paragraph-level API integration
   - Implement optimized save flow with debouncing and batching
   - Build simple test UI for demonstration
   - Conduct performance testing and optimization

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer** (3 points)
   - Update API documentation with v3 endpoints
   - Create developer guide for the new document structure
   - Document frontend integration patterns
   - Prepare demonstration for stakeholders

## Story Points
Total: 29 points (This will likely need to be split into multiple sprints)

## Definition of Done
- All code is reviewed and merged into the development branch
- Unit tests achieve at least 85% code coverage
- Integration tests verify all API endpoints function correctly
- Performance tests confirm 30% or greater reduction in data transfer
- Migration script successfully converts test data without errors
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- Product Owner has approved the proof-of-concept demonstration

## Dependencies
- MongoDB schema changes must be finalized before API development begins
- API endpoints must be functional before frontend implementation can be completed
- Existing document service technical specifications

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Migration of existing documents may cause data loss
   **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive backup strategy, develop validation tools to verify data integrity before and after migration, implement rollback plan

2. **Risk**: Performance may not improve as expected
   **Mitigation**: Implement detailed performance monitoring, have fallback design options, identify performance bottlenecks early

3. **Risk**: Backward compatibility issues with existing frontend
   **Mitigation**: Maintain v2 endpoints alongside v3, comprehensive integration testing, phased rollout strategy

## Team Assessment
- Backend expertise: High (MongoDB, .NET API development)
- Frontend expertise: Medium (Angular, Froala integration)
- Estimated development time: 3-4 weeks
- Confidence level: High for technical implementation, Medium for performance improvements

## Sprint Planning Notes
Due to the size and complexity, this feature should be broken down into three separate user stories:
1. MongoDB schema redesign and migration (8 points)
2. API v3 endpoints implementation (8 points)
3. Frontend POC development (13 points)

Recommended approach is to implement these across 2-3 sprints, prioritizing the database work first, followed by API development, and finally the frontend implementation.
